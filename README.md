## üöÄ Deployment on Vercel

This app uses **Angular CSR (Client-Side Rendering)** and is deployed on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)**.

### How to deploy:
1. **Build the project** using Angular CLI:
ng build --configuration=production


2. **Deploy the `dist/portfolio-website` folder** on Vercel.

3. Once deployed, **every push to `main`** will **auto-deploy** the latest version!

### Recommended Git Strategy

- Your default branch: `main`
- For production snapshots:  
‚û§ Create release branches like: `rel/first-launch`, `rel/fix-dark-mode`, etc.
- For new features:  
‚û§ Work in feature branches like: `feat/contact-section`, `feat/theme-toggle`, etc.

> ‚úÖ Push to `main` only after verifying features on a separate branch.  
> üîÑ Vercel will auto-deploy the latest `main`.

# PortfolioWebsite

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
